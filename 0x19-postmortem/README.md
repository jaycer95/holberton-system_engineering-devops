# POSTMORTEM
> Working in IT, we all know that from time to time, things go off the rails, despite our planning and best intentions. When things go really wrong, you might be asked to write an Incident Report that can be shared with senior executives, fellow staff, or even customers.
 A postmortem is a tool widely used in the tech industry. After any outage, the team(s) in charge of the system will write a summary that has 2 main goals:
 To provide the rest of the companyâ€™s employees easy access to information detailing the cause of the outage. Often outages can have a huge impact on a company, so managers and executives have to understand what happened and how it will impact their work.
 And to ensure that the root cause(s) of the outage has been discovered and that measures are taken to make sure it will be fixed.
